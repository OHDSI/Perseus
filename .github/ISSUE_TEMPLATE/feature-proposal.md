Perseus feature proposals use the following checklist to track when a 
proposal is ready to be considered for implementation by the OHDSI community.

- [ ] Include a one paragraph brief summarizing the scope of the proposal.
       Outline the scope of the proposal by using plain language, and also be explicit
       about what is out of scope.
- [ ] Summarize the key user personas that will be affected by this proposal. Describe the
       user workflow.
- [ ] Summarize the value created by the proposal - ex. what audience will be impacted
      and what is the size of that audience. What are the limitations of the existing solutions.
- [ ] Describe a strategy for acceptance testing of the proposal.
- [ ] Is the proposal supported by the current (non-functional) design? 
      If not, also draft a design proposal for review. List the relevant design proposals and
      how they are related to this feature proposal.
- [ ] Draft the development tasks that would be required to implement the proposal.
      Estimate the level of effort for each task in person days. No task should take more
      than 5 person days.
- [ ] Summarize the anticipated maintenance costs for the proposal.

  - Does the proposal have a dependency on 
    cross-cutting functionality such as database management, scheduling, logging etc.? What
    maintenance would be required if the implementation of that cross-cutting concern changed.
  - Does the proposal have an implicit dependency on future releases?
    For example, support for new SDK's, bindings or new documentation specifications
    would all require ongoing updates in future releases.
  - End user support: What support will end user personas require to use the feature?
    How will that support requirement be mitigated.
        
- [ ] Provide a plan for executing/sponsoring the implementation and maintenance of the proposal.
      What are the main risks to implementation and how can they be mitigated?
- [ ] Attend the Perseus Working Group to discuss your proposal.
